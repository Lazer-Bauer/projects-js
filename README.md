# This is a js project which is consisted of 8 js project and the home page which in effect could count as another project I will go through it all one by one

# home page

the home page is made out of an header which is fixed, and then it has two parts to it(not completely accurate will explain later) first part which is called main page, is the main gallery page which displays all the the js projects, by a rendering of js. With it in the main page there a few more sections like about, home and contact .
When clicked any where in the cards of gallery it will bring you to another page which will show you about the specific project and two buttons one for download and the other a link to github and will show you technology used in that project,
What happens in click any where in the cards is that the main page is display none and project page is display =" " ,the same idea when going to back to hone page, a lot of js more than one would expect

### access to the html css js will be available in the main gitHub link which is provided by submit in kampus
